# Business Site

Second individual project for the Technigo boot camp. The assignment was to create a responsive business website with a form, an accordion and a hero image/video. This was our first assignment with Javascript.

## The problem

This was my first time using Javascript and I had a hard time grasping it at first, trying to do things that I hadn't learnt yet. 

I started by using Jamboard to make a sketch of what I wanted the site to look like. I used flexbox and grid to create the layout of the project. 

I'm relatively happy with the end result, however I'm not pleased with the header. I spent a lot of time on trying to get the h1-element centered, which should have worked with the code I added. In the end I ran out of time and had to delete what I added. If I had more time I would have focused on centering the h1-element and also tried to style the checkboxes and radio buttons. 

While doing this project I learned the importance of having a clean and easy to read code from the beginning of the project. I spent four hours trying to figure out why my project wasn't acting like I expected it to, only to find a section closing tag in the middle of the code.
